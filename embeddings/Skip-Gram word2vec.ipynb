    "When you're dealing with language and words, you end up with tens of thousands of classes to predict, one for each word. Trying to one-hot encode these words is massively inefficient, you'll have one element set to 1 and the other 50,000 set to 0. The word2vec algorithm finds much more efficient representations by finding vectors that represent the words. These vectors also contain semantic information about the words. Words that show up in similar contexts, such as \"black\", \"white\", and \"red\" will have vectors near each other. There are two architectures for implementing word2vec, CBOW (Continuous Bag-Of-Words) and Skip-gram.\n",

    "In this implementation, we'll be using the skip-gram architecture because it performs better than CBOW. Here, we pass in a word and try to predict the words surrounding it in the text. In this way, we can train the network to learn representations for words that show up in similar contexts.\n",

That means for each input, we're making very small changes to millions of weights even though we only have one true example. This makes training the network very inefficient. We can approximate the loss from the softmax layer by only updating a small subset of all the weights at once. We'll update the weights for the correct label, but only a small number of incorrect labels. This is called [\"negative sampling\"](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5021-distributed-representations-of-words-and-phrases-and-their-compositionality.pdf). Tensorflow has a convenient function to do this, [`tf.nn.sampled_softmax_loss`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/sampled_softmax_loss).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Exercise:** Below, create weights and biases for the softmax layer. Then, use [`tf.nn.sampled_softmax_loss`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/sampled_softmax_loss) to calculate the loss. Be sure to read the documentation to figure out how it works."
